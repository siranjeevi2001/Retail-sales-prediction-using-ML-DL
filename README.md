Introduction
Retail sales prediction is a crucial task for inventory management, supply chain optimization, and marketing strategies. This project uses XGBoost, a powerful gradient boosting framework, to predict retail sales based on historical data. The results are visualized using a Streamlit dashboard for easy interaction and analysis.

Installation
To run this project, follow the steps below:

Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/retail-sales-prediction.git
cd retail-sales-prediction
Create a virtual environment and activate it:

bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
Install the required packages:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains historical sales data, including features such as:

Date
Store ID
Product ID
Sales
Promotion
Other relevant features
Feature Engineering
The following steps were performed for feature engineering:

Handling missing values
Encoding categorical variables
Creating new features based on date (e.g., day of the week, month)
Normalizing/Scaling numerical features
Modeling
XGBoost was chosen for its efficiency and performance in handling large datasets and complex relationships. The model was trained on the preprocessed data and tuned for optimal performance.

Evaluation
The model's performance was evaluated using Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). Cross-validation was also performed to ensure the model's robustness.

Streamlit Dashboard
A Streamlit dashboard was created to visualize the predictions and insights from the model. The dashboard includes:

Interactive charts and graphs
User inputs for custom predictions
Summary statistics and performance metrics
Usage
To run the Streamlit app:

Ensure you are in the project directory and the virtual environment is activated.

Run the Streamlit app:

bash
Copy code
streamlit run app.py
Open the provided local URL in your web browser to interact with the dashboard.
